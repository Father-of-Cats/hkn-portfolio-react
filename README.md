## Description
This is a WIP portfolio built with React to demonstrate my ability and understand of the React framework.

## Future Development 
* Due to time constraints I relayed heavily on Bootstrap, I would like to move away from BS to CSS built by me.
* I built a darkmode toggle that I would like to implement when I change over the CSS from BS
* I'd like to remove some of the hardcoding such as in the Nav links for ease of use/updating
* Better projects in my portfolio
